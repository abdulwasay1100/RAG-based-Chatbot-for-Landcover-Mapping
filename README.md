# RAG-based-Chatbot-for-Landcover-Mapping
The proposed approach integrates remote sensing data with Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze land cover,
emphasizing sustainable resource management. The workflow seamlessly incorporates response creation, retrieval augmentation, semantic segmentation, and image captioning. Leveraging the DeepLabV3 architecture with a ResNet34
encoder, the Segmentation Deep Neural Network, trained on the DeepGlobe dataset, demonstrates proficiency in classifying land use. The obtained results not only showcase the modelâ€™s linguistic precision in interpreting user inquiries
but also include visualizations illustrating both successful and challenging scenarios.
